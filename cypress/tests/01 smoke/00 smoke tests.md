# Aims
* The smoke tests should be as fast as possible
* If the footer element is not drawn, then there is a high likelihood that the page painting has encountered a fault, so just see if it is there.
# In scope
* All chapters:
  * Presence and text content (not necessaily complete) of a few important bits (title, headings, the footer div,...).
* The main navigation can
  * Take you to expected chapters 
# Out of Scope
* functionality of the chapter pages
* legacy navigation routes
