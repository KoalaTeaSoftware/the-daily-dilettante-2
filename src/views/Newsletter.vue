      <p>We're hotting up, now, this end!</p>
      <p>
        Please, if anyone didn't receive their Release form, do give me a buzz

      <p>We start shooting this first feature film, an anthology feature called "Hardy's Regrets", this month.</p>
      <p>The first short in this series is "The Superstitious Man", and is being shot OUTDOORS, on Portland, Dorset, on
        23/24th April and then INDOORS (by the kind courtesy of The Royal manor Theatre, Portland!!) at their theatre on
        30th April/1st May.</p>
      <p>HAVE you all learnt your lines, people? I'm looking forward to seeing you all very much. Oh, if you know any
        Dorset-based people, we still need a few Runners and featured extras: these latter for later in the early
        summer,
        so
        please send them my way and I'll be forever grateful!!</p>
      <h2>THE GREENLANDS</h2>
      <h3>The Dramatic Podcasts</h3>
      <p>Our editor, Josh Bailey has done an ace job of editing the 'Specials' for The Greenlands' Chronicles.</p>
      <p>The first two of these will be going up on Podbean, itunes and my website (keep an eye on
        https://the-greenlands.com/stories) this month. Great job, everyone...</p>
      <p>Sorry it's been a bit of a time to release. Just had to chase a few people for forgotten lines, etc.</p>
      <p><em>Thanks everyone and look forward to meeting all you new actors/crew on Portland (Dorset!!), this
        spring/summer!</em></p>
